## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant purple (#A076F2) to evoke creativity and fun, reminiscent of artistic expression and imagination.
- Background color: A light, desaturated lavender (#F2EFFF) that complements the primary color and provides a soft, inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: A playful pink (#F276BB) adds a touch of excitement and energy, highlighting important elements such as action buttons.
- Clear, readable font optimized for both mobile and desktop screens. Use distinct font weights to separate game messages from regular chats.
- Simple, intuitive icons to represent game actions and settings. Use bright colors that are distinct from one another, making them scannable at a distance.
- Clean, responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Ensure all interactive elements are easily accessible on both desktop and touch devices.
- Subtle animations for UI transitions, such as the reveal of the drawing canvas or the submission of a guess. Use CSS or Javascript animations to show elements that have recently changed.
